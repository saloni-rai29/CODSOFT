# Description
The "Guess the Number" game project is an interactive Java program where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. The program provides feedback to the user on whether the guessed number is greater, lower, or the correct number. Additionally, it keeps track of the number of attempts made by the user.

# Game Flow
1. The program generates a random number.
2. The user inputs a guess.
3. If the guess is incorrect, the program informs the user if the number is greater or lower than the guessed number.
4. The user continues to guess until they correctly identify the random number or reach the maximum number of attempts.
5. The program ends if the user guesses the correct number within 10 attempts or exceeds the maximum attempts allowed.

# Number of Attempts
The game limits the user to 10 attempts to guess the correct number. If the user exceeds this limit, the game terminates automatically.

# Replay Option
After each game, the program prompts the user if they want to play again. If the user chooses to continue, a new random number is generated for another round of game.

"Welcome to my Student Grade Calculator project! This project is designed to help calculate the total marks obtained, average percentage, and the grade obtained based on the marks entered for each subject."

"The user is prompted to enter the number of subjects, followed by the marks obtained out of 100 in each subject. The program then calculates the total marks obtained, average percentage, and determines the grade based on the grading system."

Lastly, you can mention the key features or technologies used in your project:

"This project utilizes basic arithmetic calculations to determine the results. It's a simple yet effective tool for students to track their academic performance easily."

# Description:
The ATM Interface Program is a Java project designed to simulate an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) experience. When a user runs the program, they are prompted with options to choose from:
1. Withdrawal: Allows the user to withdraw a certain amount from their account.
2. Deposit: Enables the user to deposit funds into their account.
3. Check Balance: Displays the current balance in the user's account.
4. Exit: Exits the program.

Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding action. For example, if the user selects withdrawal, they will be asked to enter the amount they wish to withdraw, and the program will deduct that amount from their account balance. Similarly, for deposit, the program will prompt the user to input the amount to be deposited and update the account balance accordingly. Checking the balance will simply display the current balance without any changes.

This project showcases the use of conditional statements and user input handling in Java to create an interactive ATM-like experience. It provides a practical demonstration of how programming can be used to simulate real-world scenarios.
